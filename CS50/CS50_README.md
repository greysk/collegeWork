# CS50 - README

This folder contains completed (and a few incomplete) assignmend for CS50 from both [2021](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) and [2022](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/). Many of the projects are "fill in" and I wrote only part of the code. None of this code should be used by anyone else, because I do not have a license to the work.
